This is the personal web presence of Kyle Johnston. I live in Maine, have two cats, and work as a Linux/cloud engineer.

This is my space to own my own content outside the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, and Advance Publications.

These are the principles of muumu.us:

- **Write the content I want to write.** I'm not beholden to anyone but myself in this space. No one wants to read blog spam; interesting writing comes from authors who care about their subject.
- **Optimize for readability and discoverability.** Minimal design with no distractions, ads, etc. Visitors should be able to easily find things they're interested in and have a pleasurable reading experience.
- **Keep page sizes small.** No web fonts, minimal JavaScript (none at all right now), minimal styling, sparing use of images. This keeps load times fast, makes the site more energy efficient, and reduces my bandwidth costs.
- **Respect the privacy of my readers.** No user tracking outside of CloudFront logs and metrics.

The site is static HTML generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). The source code is in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/kylerjohnston/muumu.us "kylerjohnston/muumu.us on GitHub"). It's hosted in an S3 bucket, fronted by CloudFront.
