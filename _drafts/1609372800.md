## Books

### *The Information* by James Gleick 
A popular history of information science. I listened to an audiobook through
Audible at the beginning of the year --- I get offered a free month trial every
once in a while to try and entice me back. It was absolutely riveting, and
probably the best pop-science writing I've read. This field --- information
science --- was the thing I had wanted to study in college and grad school, but
I had never heard this term and I didn't know what to call it or how to
articulate what I wanted. Instead I studied "digital humanities." I never
finished this because I stopped listening to audiobooks when I stopped commuting
to work. I should buy a text copy of it to finish.

### *Moonwalking with Einstein* by Joshua Foer
Another audiobook I listened to in January/February that I didn't finish. The
premise sounded interesting --- a journalist spends a year training his memory
in order to enter an international memory competition --- but I found myself
bored and disliking most of the characters and wondering what the point was. I
don't plan on buying a text copy of this.

### *The Well-Grounded Rubyist* by David Black
I read this in the beginning of the year. This book was a great overview of the
Ruby language, and, really, a good introduction to programming in general.
Highly recommended. One of very few programming books I read cover to cover.
Could do with more exercises, maybe.

### *Ansible for DevOps* by Jeff Geerling
I started reading this some time in the spring and found the first couple
chapters too basic, so I skipped ahead and still felt it was too basic. Maybe I
knew Ansible better than I thought? I didn't end up finishing this, but I don't
feel like I got much out of it, or that I was going to get much more. Would be a
good intro, maybe, if you had never used Ansible before. Although the Ansible
documentation is also very good, so I'm not sure why this is needed.

### *Ficciones* by Jorge Luis Borges 
A collection of short stories by the famous Argentine author. I purchased it in
August and have been reading stories here and there since. I finished it in
January of this year. Borges has always intrigued me and I knew the plots of
many of the stories in this collection already --- he is referenced frequently
in the critical theory I read in college and grad school --- but I'd never
gotten around to reading him. The language is erudite and the imagined book
reviews can be slogs, but the high points --- *The Garden of Forking Paths*,
*Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius*, and *The Library of Babel* --- are unforgetable.

### *Programming Elixir* by Dave Thomas
Purchased at the end of August. Lots of great info here, but something about
Thomas's style made it hard for me to parse --- I often had to read sentences
several times to get what he was saying. In many cases I found the Elixir docs
more lucid, but I did find the book helpful in providing a structure through
which to approach learning the various aspects of Elixir. I've put Elixir aside
for the moment so I still haven't finished this.

### *The New Media Reader* edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort
After reading *The Information* and learning about Ted Nelson and Project Xanadu
from somewhere I wanted to read some of the essays in here, so I bought a used
copy off Amazon in September. I haven't read much of it --- "As We May Think" by
Vannevar Bush, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by Alan Turing (a
brilliant essay), and excerpts from *Computer Lib/Dream Machines* by Ted Nelson.
Now that I think about it, that was why I bought this --- I wanted a copy of
that book, but it's out of print and used copies were going for a couple hundred
dollars on Amazon.

### *Dune* by Frank Herbert
For some reason I started craving science fiction in October. I used to read a
lot of science fiction, but haven't in years. I downloaded a sample of *Dune*
and the opening chapter, with references to the Butlerian Jihad's destruction of
"intelligent machines" and painful tests to determine if one is human, had me
hooked. I think I was also watching a lot of Rob Miles' AI safety videos on
YouTube at this time. It was an epic book.

### *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. LeGuin
I read this in December after *Dune*, wanting another sci-fi fix. The first
couple chapters dragged but once I got through them it was a very quick read.
One odd, out of place, scene of sexual assault really disrupted my immersion (I
think LeGuin was trying to make a comment on alchol here?), but it was an
otherwise beautiful look at what it means and takes to be free.
