In September I created [public-notes.muumu.us](https://public-notes.muumu.us
"public-notes.muumu.us"), a project to create a personal knowledge base
and publish it on the public internet. I chose
[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/ "TiddlyWiki") for the project for reasons I
outlined in an earlier post, [Building an internet-facing TiddlyWiki for my
public second brain]({% post_url 2020-09-06-building-a-public-tiddlywiki %}
"Building an internet-facing TiddlyWiki for my public second brain - muumu.us").
TiddlyWiki's non-heirarchical approach to note taking is unique and I find its
ergonomics mesh much better with my thought process than a traditional wiki or
something like Evernote. TiddlyWiki is one of a very few pieces of software that
feels completely effortless to use. 

So I chose TiddlyWiki for its great user interface, despite some other
deficiencies that made it a less than ideal choice for the project, like only
supporting HTTP basic authentication. Using public-notes over the past couple
months, the basic auth flow stands out as a real pain point in an otherwise
smooth experience. I use Firefox for a browser and Bitwarden as a password
manager, on both desktop and mobile, and the user experience for getting through
basic auth is frustrating. The basic auth window steals the focus and prevents
you from clicking back into the browser, like you'd need to do to grab your
password from the Bitwarden plugin, so you need to remember to copy the password
*before* navigating to the site --- and since you're not already on the site,
Bitwarden won't autosuggest it and you'll have to search for it. If you forget
to perform that ritual you will have to cancel out of the basic auth window,
perform the rite, and try an incantation of hard refreshes and new private
windows to get the authentication box to reappear --- on the occasional, and
somewhat concerning, refresh the page will simply load without even prompting to
authenticate. On mobile this whole performance is painful enough that I stopped
using it, and the only reason I put the project on the internet to begin with
was to more easily access it via my phone.

There has to be a better way to do this. You will find
[twproxy](https://github.com/stevenleeg/twproxy "stevenleeg/twproxy - GitHub")
suggested as a solution on the TiddlyWiki Google Group. It's a Ruby/Sinatra
application that proxies requests to TiddlyWiki and adds authentication. It
sounded like a good solution, but I ran into a problem described [in an issue on
the project's GitHub](https://github.com/stevenleeg/twproxy/issues/6 "TW
returning 403 on attempted save") where the TiddlyWiki would only render for an
instant before throwing a `Sync error while processing '$:/StoryList'`. I spent
an hour or so starting to fix it last Saturday, but fixing that one bug revealed
another and I started falling down a rabbit hole of trying to fix outdated
dependencies. I became demotivated when I saw there was already a pull request
on the project, open and untouched for three months, that purported to fix the
issue --- although, for what it's worth, I couldn't get that PR's branch working
either, and there are no tests.

Ultimately, twproxy didn't seem like the right approach to me anyway. I already
have NGINX set up as a reverse proxy on TiddlyWiki --- why do I need another
proxy in front of that? After some Googling I found that, using the
`auth_request` module, NGINX will verify each request against an external
authentication server before passing it upstream. The article [Authentication
Based on Subrequest
Result](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/
"Authentication Based on Subrequest Result - NGINX Plus Admin Guide") from the
NGINX Plus Admin Guide explains it well:

> NGINX and NGINX Plus can authenticate each request to your website with an
> external server or service. To perform authentication, NGINX makes an HTTP
> subrequest to an external server where the subrequest is verified. If the
> subrequest returns a `2xx` response code, the access is allowed, if it returns
> `401` or `403`, the access is denied. Such type of authentication allows
> implementing various authentication schemes, such as multifactor
> authentication, or allows implementing LDAP or OAuth authentication.

That sounds like a good solution, but I still need to find an authentication
service to handle verifying the requests. All of the existing solutions I found
seemed like overkill for my single-user use case --- I didn't want to set up a
Keycloak or a FreeIPA server. Django comes with user management out of the box,
though --- it would be trivial to spin up a small Django app to just provide the
ability to login/logout, and validate if users are logged in by returning a
`200` or a `403`. So that's what I did.
